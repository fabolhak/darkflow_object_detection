# Object detection using Darkflow (YOLO) in ROS
Detects objects using darkflow (YOLO) and outputs bounding boxes.

Requirements:
* [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
* [darkflow](https://github.com/fabolhak/darkflow) (included as submodule)
* [drive_ros_msgs](https://github.com/tum-phoenix/drive_ros_msgs) (bounding box message definition)

Add *.weights file manually. It is probably too big for GitHub and therefore all *.weights files are ignored in git.
