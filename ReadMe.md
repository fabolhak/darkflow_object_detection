# Vehicle Detection using Darkflow (YOLO)
Detects vehicles using darkflow (YOLO) and outputs bounding boxes as array of polygons (bounding boxes in image coordinates).

Requirements: 
* tensorflow
* darkflow

Add *.weights file manually. It is probably too big for GitHub and therefore all *.weights files are ignored in git.
